Slide 1: Title
"Improving Observability Across On-Prem Kubernetes Clusters"

Hello everyone,
Today I want to propose an initiative to improve observability for our on-premises Kubernetes clusters, tailored to the specific needs of application teams.

Slide 2: Current State
We currently use:

Sysdig for system-level monitoring

Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

Splunk for logs

This works, but the data isn't always actionable or visible in the right way for different teams.

Slide 3: The Vision
My proposal:

Create custom Grafana dashboards for each team

Pull in metrics from:

Prometheus

Splunk (critical logs, errors)

Kafka (message flow)

MQ systems (queue length, processing time)

Set up alerting directly to Microsoft Teams

The goal is to bridge the gap between raw data and useful insights.

Slide 4: Tracing & AI Potential
Next steps:

Implement Jaeger for distributed tracing

Add visibility into request flows, bottlenecks, and latencies

In the future, integrate AI-powered log and error analysis

Speed up root cause analysis

Proactively suggest fixes

Slide 5: Why This Matters
Benefits:

Clear, role-specific observability for dev and ops teams

"Making Monitoring Accessible and Actionable for All Teams"
The primary goal is to build a unified observability layer that delivers clear, relevant, and actionable insights to every team â€” enabling faster response, better collaboration, and more confident operations.

Faster incident response

Less noise, more context

Foundation for intelligent automation and AI
