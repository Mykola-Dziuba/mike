Slide 1: Title
"Improving Observability Across On-Prem Kubernetes Clusters"

Hello everyone,
Today I want to propose an initiative to improve observability for our on-premises Kubernetes clusters, tailored to the specific needs of application teams.

Slide 2: Current State
We currently use:

Sysdig for system-level monitoring

Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

Splunk for logs

This works, but the data isn't always actionable or visible in the right way for different teams.

Slide 3: The Vision
My proposal:

Create custom Grafana dashboards for each team

Pull in metrics from:

Prometheus

Splunk (critical logs, errors)

Kafka (message flow)

MQ systems (queue length, processing time)

Set up alerting directly to Microsoft Teams

The goal is to bridge the gap between raw data and useful insights.

Slide 4: Tracing & AI Potential
Next steps:

Implement Jaeger for distributed tracing

Add visibility into request flows, bottlenecks, and latencies

In the future, integrate AI-powered log and error analysis

Speed up root cause analysis

Proactively suggest fixes

Slide 5: Why This Matters
Benefits:

Clear, role-specific observability for dev and ops teams
"Making Monitoring Accessible and Actionable for All Teams"
The primary goal is to build a unified observability layer that delivers clear, relevant, and actionable insights to every team — enabling faster response, better collaboration, and more confident operations.

Faster incident response

Less noise, more context

Foundation for intelligent automation and AI

About Me & Why This Initiative
I’ve been working at Nordea for over 2 years as a DevOps engineer.
During this time, I’ve been actively involved in adapting and delivering GORM releases, handling production incidents, and—like every member of our team—spending countless hours digging through logs and metrics to identify issues.

Based on this hands-on experience, I’d like to present our team’s vision for improving observability and unlocking its full potential.


###
The Challenge with Our Current Monitoring Stack
We use several monitoring tools:
Sysdig
Grafana / Prometheus
Splunk
Databases monitoring by DB team 

These are separate systems, and the challenge is that, as an engineer, I often have to manually correlate data across at least three different sources to investigate issues.

This process is time-consuming, requires deep expertise, and slows down incident resolution.
